This script is designed to check the temperature of your CPU and GPU. I created it for my brother, who experienced his custom-built computer shutting down due to high temperatures while living far away from me and having no experience. With this script, I can quickly access the necessary information the next time such an incident occurs. The database files can easily be connected to Dropbox or any other storage and sharing platform.

Please note that this script is meant for informational purposes only and should not be solely relied upon to prevent overheating issues. It is always advisable to implement proper cooling solutions and regularly monitor hardware temperatures for optimal performance and longevity.


If you are interested in using this script, please note that it requires the user to have OpenHardwareMonitor installed and running. I recommend configuring it to start automatically and creating a batch file that starts the Python script in the background.

By having OpenHardwareMonitor running, the script will be able to access the necessary temperature data for your CPU and GPU. This allows for accurate monitoring and analysis of the temperature levels.

To ensure smooth operation, please follow these steps:

Install OpenHardwareMonitor on your computer.
Configure OpenHardwareMonitor to start automatically when your computer boots up.
Create a batch file that launches the Python script in the background. This will allow the script to run continuously and provide temperature updates.
Make sure both OpenHardwareMonitor and the Python script are running simultaneously for the script to fetch temperature data correctly.
Remember, it's important to regularly check and maintain proper cooling solutions for your computer to prevent overheating issues.


If you wanna use a batch for this script, set [reading = "yes"] to "no" so it runs as it should do.

You can change the limiter by yourself if needed.

.db file is not requierd it will be created automatically once the script starts for the first time (in the same folder).









Note:
Please be aware that this script may not work in every environment or with every CPU. While it should work with most CPUs, there may be compatibility issues with certain models.

I have encountered some issues with a specific CPU, but in general, the script should function properly with a wide range of CPUs.

If you encounter any problems or inconsistencies while using the script, I recommend checking for updates or searching for alternative solutions that are more compatible with your specific CPU model.

Remember to exercise caution when using third-party scripts and ensure that you have proper backups and safeguards in place to protect your data and hardware.
